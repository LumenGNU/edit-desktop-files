Edit Desktop Files Extension
-------------------------
This is a temporary copy for editing. 
After saving and closing editor, file will be validated and
copied to ~/.local/share/applications/

Comments starting with #EDF# will not be copied to the resulting file.

If you clear this file (leave it empty or with comments only):
- If system-wide .desktop file exists: it will be used instead
- If no system-wide file: the application will be removed from menu
In both cases the local file will be moved to Trash.
